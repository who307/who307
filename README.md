###
As a UI/UX developer in my current role, I work closely with web planners, designers, and developers to create user-friendly and visually engaging web applications.
###
My main responsibilities include developing and maintaining markup, UI components, and interactive user experiences. I focus on delivering intuitive interactions through thoughtful UX design, while adhering to web standards, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility. I also ensure clear and effective communication among all stakeholders throughout the development process.
